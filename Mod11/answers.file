Decoded Message: HAPPINESS IS A PROGRAM WITHOUT ERRORS
Method: Wrote a simple C program to crack the shift cipher.
1. This definately does not resemble the process of decoding the human genome - the human genome is made of groups of three base four codons, which total up to base 64 (64 possible combinations.) People know what amino acids each of these codons invoke, but they do not know what the various long sequences of amino acids mean. Cracking a simple shift cipher (and even XOR or Vigenere, yes I have taken Cryptography) is MUCH easier than the process of decoding the human genome.
2. Online collaboration is great for me - the benifits definately outweigh the cons. The benifits include no need to watch for eye contact or facial expressions or tone of voice, things that people ALWAYS misinterpret me with, AND the fact that you can read over your messages before sending. The cons are that lack of facial expressions may cause misunderstandings, but I've been able to reword my responses (using the extra delay before sending) to avoid that.
3. Google Docs definately will simplify this process because instead of having to send daily emails back and forth, we could just create a program on it and add comments, and therefore have a centralized document for this entire project.
4. You must be able to explain things well and make sure people understand you, and to understand things well and correctly. I think I do have these skills, but it is very hard to judge yourself accurately.
5. You need to be good at and understand the things that you are collaborating on. I definately have these skills, at least in my area of expertise.
6. Physical education - it would need you to be able to see each other and their progress. Also, working with electronics. It would be hard soldering something via the internet...
